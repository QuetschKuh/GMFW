# Gamemode Framework
Legacy framework I used for some of my minecraft plugins. Deprecated because of development on GMFW2.
This code is all quite old and quickly rather than carefully thrown together.
All in all this is a viable base for gamemodes and provides all important features and customizations you may want.
HOWEVER. I decided to completely stop development on this since it's difficult to maintain, partially illegible, and just plain bad.
I am currently working on a second, more polished, more structured and way more legible version adhering to basic programming principles.
